## Week 4

Description: Learn about convolutional neural networks (interesting!)

- Complete the given tutorials. Complete the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) part of the tutorials.
- Use a convolutional neural network to identify cats vs dogs. Find a cats vs dogs dataset yourselves on kaggle ðŸ˜….  
- This time, set up a convolutional neural network that can take images from the MNIST dataset and identify them accurately. Point to consider: The number of units in the output layer. This is not a binary classification problem like cats vs dogs, so ponder about the number of units in the output layer in both the tasks.

**You can submit .py as well as .ipynb files for this task.**

_Optional_: 
- If you are interested about neural networks and want to learn more, you can explore [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models?specialization=deep-learning)

- Read [this](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/10/a-step-by-step-introduction-to-the-basic-object-detection-algorithms-part-1/) blog and ~~try to ðŸ«£~~ implement an object detection model using CNN (there are various types of CNNs: R-CNNs, FCNNs, etc. Lookup about them. You could try comparing them on object detection performance as well!)
