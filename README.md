# SoC - Image Super Resolution using Deep Neural Networks

**Week 1:** Learning basics of python, familiarise yourself with numpy and other python libraries \
**Week 2:** Implementing PCA, logistic and linear regression using numpy \
**Week 3:** Understanding PyTorch and using it to implement a simple feed forward neural network(option assignment: make the neural network using numpy only) \
**Week 4:** Implementing convolution neural network (CNN) along with focus on thoroughly understanding its backpropogation step \
**Week 5:** Understanding the basics of image super resolution \
**Week 6:** Finalizing a research paper to implement and a dataset to go along with it \
**Week 7-8:** Implementing the research paper

**Note:**
If you feel that the SoC is basic or slow please feel free to contact us, there is a lot to learn ;)
