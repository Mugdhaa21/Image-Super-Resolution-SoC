## Week 3

Description: Learn about neural networks and pytorch

- Read the introductory chapter from “Introduction To Machine Learning - Gurney et. al.” and optionally the theory (Highly recommended)
- Complete the given tutorials. You may leave the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) part of the tutorials for next week.
- Set up a basic feed forward neural network that can take images from the MNIST dataset and identify them accurately. You can use the Pytorch library to do this. **You can submit .py as well as .ipynb files for this task.**

Note: We know that the tutorials we provided mostly cover the implementation of the neural network, we just want you to play with it yourself and understand each part of the code. You can also refer to the book mentioned above for a better understanding of the theory.

_Optional_: Implement the above neural network using numpy and compare the results with the Pytorch implementation.
